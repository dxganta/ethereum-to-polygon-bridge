## Setup & Installation
1. Install the dependencies in the package
```
npm i
```
2. Sign in to [Infura](https://infura.io/), create a new project, copy your project id and put it into the "infuraId" constant in the [config.js](https://github.com/realdiganta/ethereum-to-polygon-bridge/blob/main/config.js) file. Besides Infura, you can also use other developer platforms like [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide) or [Quicknode](https://quicknode.com). <br>

3. Currently, I have added only 3 tokens for the mainnet (DAI, USDC, USDT). (derc20 is a test token for the testnet) <br>

To add more tokens, you will need the ethereum contract address & the polygon contract address for that token. Then add that to the tokenToAddressMap object in the [config.js](https://github.com/realdiganta/ethereum-to-polygon-bridge/blob/main/config.js) file (taking example from the image above). Also add the token name to the "mainnet" list in the erc20Tokens object. 

To add the image for a token, add the png file to the public directory. Make sure to rename the file to the name of the token (token.png)

4. To run the dapp
```
npm run dev
```
